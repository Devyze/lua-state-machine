# lua-state-machine
A simple state machine implementation in lua.

I am a novice programmer and any tips for how to make this better would be greatly appreciated!

I took heavy inspiration from https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine and https://github.com/kyleconroy/lua-state-machine.
